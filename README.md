This code was developed specifically for engineering physics students and includes 
several features such as a scientific calculator, 
conversion calculator, solar components, harmonic oscillator, damped oscillator, 
and the Schr√∂dinger equation. 
Additionally, various experiments like nuclear decay are also incorporated.
This project, though incomplete, is written in ASP.NET and C#.
If anyone is interested, I am willing to share the code.
